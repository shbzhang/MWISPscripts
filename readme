One-line descriptions of procedures

#level0: table preparation, data download/checking#
>>>IDL<<<
├|- OBSTABLE/OBSLIST: show suitable observing time for the table
├|- MAKETABLE: use you own OFF point to write a table
|- DLBUR: download bur files from DLH database
|- DLFITS: download fits files from DLH database
|- MAPFILE: quick look the number and position of files in current directory
>>>PYTHON<<<
|- CELLMAP: python version of mapfile with better looking

#level1: preliminary data reduction#
>>>GILDAS<<<
|- AIO: put all files in one file
|- BAS: baseline fitting
|- SUM: average spectra on each position
|- MODIFY: modify frequency from 13CO to C18O
|- MAKECUBE: regrid to datacube
|- AREA: quick look of integrated intensity
|- RESAMPLE: resample the spectra and make a new datacube
>>>IDL<<<
GRID: generate grid file for regirding
GRID2: generate MWISP-II grid file for regirding
CHECKOFFSET: get possible OFF position from 12CO datacube

#level2: data reduction#
#DataCube Manipulation#
CUBEREBIN: rebin the velocity dimension of a datacube
CUBESMOOTH: convolve a datecube to a specified resolution
CUBECLIP: clip noise channels in a datecube
FITS_TRANSPOSE: transpose a datacube, e.g. from (l-b-v) to (l-v-b) or (b-v-l)
HREBINV: rebin datacube for channel map
MOSAIC: mosaic cells of DLH survey
MOSAIC_CELL: mosaic a 30*30 arcmin cell
REPROJECT: reproject a datecube to a reference coordinate

#Info Extraction#
AVERSPEC: derive the averaged spectrum of a datacube weighted with rms
CUBERMS: calculate rms noise for a datacube
CUBEMOMENT: calculate moment for a datacube
CUBEMASK: mask a datacube, only keep pixels with nchannels over threshold
PEAKVELOCITY: derive a peak velocity map of a datacube
PVSLICE: extract position-velocity map from a datacube
PVBELT: collapse position-velocity map within a belt of a datacube
RMSHIST: plot histogram of the rms distribution

#level3: merge data to galactic plane map#
MOSAIC_BSTRIP: mosaic cells to a 1 degree width strip along galactic latitude
MERGE_BSTRIP: merge moment 0 of b-strips
MWISPMERGE: merge 2-dimensional data (e.g. moment map) to galactic plane map
